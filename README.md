My first repository

Hey there, my name is Julian. I just took my first intro CS course this semester and I liked it a lot. I want to 
get better at programming, so I've begun reading an algorithms textbook and messing around with Unity. It seemed like
a logical step to become familiar with Github because it seems like a tool that a lot of people use and understand
(which I didn't). I'm primarily a physics major, but I will be getting a second major in Computer Science, which I'm
super excited about. That's about it in terms of why I'm here. Like I said, I don't know much about technology in general
yet, so I don't know if anyone will ever read this, but here it is...
